## Template 2: Follow-Up - Value Proposition

**Subject:** Re: Seller leads in [Neighborhood] - still interested?

Hi [Agent Name],

Quick follow-up on my previous email about pre-qualified seller leads.

I wanted to share what makes KeyMatch different:

**Our Leads:**
- 🏠 Respond to "What's my home worth?" searches
- 📞 Are contacted within 5 minutes by our AI assistant
- ✅ Are verified for contact info and property ownership
- 📅 Have selling timeline of <6 months
- 💰 No upfront costs - pay only on closed deals

**Recent Success:** Agent Sarah Chen closed 2 deals in her first month with us, earning $31,000 in commissions from our leads.

We have 3 sellers ready to speak with an agent this week. Want me to send you their details?

## Template 3: LinkedIn Outreach

**Subject:** Quick question about your buyer leads

Hi [Agent Name],

I see you're actively helping buyers in [City] - great work in this market!

Quick question: How satisfied are you with your current lead generation?

I ask because we've developed a system that delivers pre-qualified SELLER leads (not tire-kickers) directly to agents. No monthly fees, no junk leads - just motivated sellers ready to list.

Would you be open to a brief 5-minute call to see if this could help your business?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 4: Referral Request

What [Mutual Connection] liked about us:
- Leads are pre-qualified by our team
- No monthly fees or contracts

## Template 5: Re-engagement 

**Subject:** 5 sellers, 0 agents 😬

Hi [Agent Name],

Awkward situation...

We have 5 motivated sellers in [Area] who want to list their homes, but our partner agents are at capacity.

These aren't cold leads - they've:
- ✓ Requested home valuations
- ✓ Confirmed they want to sell
- ✓ Agreed to speak with an agent

Before I refer them elsewhere, wanted to check if you have bandwidth for new listings?

If yes, just reply "SEND THEM" and I'll introduce you.

[Your Name]
P.S. Two are looking to list this month.
