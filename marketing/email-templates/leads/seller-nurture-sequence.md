## Email 3: Success Story (Send Day 2)

**Subject:** How [Similar Neighbor] Sold for $15K Over Asking

Hi [First Name],

Thought you'd be interested in this...

Last month, a homeowner at [Nearby Street] was in a similar situation. They needed to sell but were worried about:
- Getting a fair price
- How long it would take
- Dealing with repairs and showings

**Here's what happened:**
- Listed on a Tuesday
- 14 showings in 4 days
- 3 offers (all over asking)
- Sold for $15,000 above list price
- Closed in 21 days

The key? They worked with an agent who knew exactly how to position their home in this market.

I can connect you with the same caliber of agent. Interested?
